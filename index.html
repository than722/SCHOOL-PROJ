            <h2 class="poppins-bold">The Colonization of the Philippines</h2>
            <p class="p1">The era spanning from 1565 to 1898 in Philippine history is referred to as the Spanish colonial period. 
                During this time, the Philippine Islands were governed as the Captaincy General of the Philippines within the Spanish East Indies, initially falling under the Viceroyalty of New Spain, headquartered in Mexico City. 
                However, after the Mexican Empire gained independence from Spain in 1821, the Philippines came under direct Spanish control, a period marked by governmental instability. 
                The first recorded European encounter with the Philippines occurred in 1521 during Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigation expedition, which ended tragically for him in the Battle of Mactan. 
                In 1565, Spanish conquistadors, led by Miguel López de Legazpi, embarked on the conquest of the Philippines from modern-day Mexico. Their arrival coincided with the reign of Philip II of Spain, whose name became associated with the country. 
                The Spanish colonial era came to an end with Spain's defeat by the United States in the Spanish-American War, signaling the onset of the American colonial period in Philippine history.</p>

            <p class="p2">The Spanish colonial motives in the Philippines extended beyond mere commerce, initially aiming for access to the lucrative Spice Islands. 
                Despite losing this opportunity to the Portuguese and Dutch, the Spanish persisted in their presence in the archipelago. 
                Ferdinand Magellan led the first Spanish expedition to the Philippines in 1521, 
                but subsequent attempts by King Philip II resulted in disasters until Miguel López de Legazpi established the first permanent Spanish settlement in Cebu in 1565. 
                By the late 16th century, most coastal and lowland areas were under Spanish control, with nominal conversion to Roman Catholicism.</p>

            <h4 class="poppins-bold">The 19th Century</h4>
            <p class="p3"> By the late 18th century, Europe's political and economic transformations were beginning to impact Spain and consequently the Philippines. 
                A significant catalyst for trade was the gradual dismantling of the galleon's monopoly route to Acapulco. The last galleon reached Manila in 1815, and by the mid-1830s, Manila had opened up to foreign merchants with minimal restrictions. 
                This led to increased demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp), with exports to Europe surging further following the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869.</p>

            <h5 class="poppins-bold">The Philippine Revolution</h5>
            <p class="p4">In August of 1896, Spanish friars uncovered evidence of the Katipunan's plans, leading its leaders to take action earlier than planned. Revolts erupted in several provinces around Manila. Despite months of fighting, severe Spanish retaliation forced the revolutionary armies to retreat to the hills. 
                In December 1897, a truce was reached with the Spanish. Emilio Aguinaldo, a municipal mayor and rebel forces commander, received a significant sum and was permitted to go to Hong Kong with other leaders, with promises of reforms from the Spanish. However, reforms were slow, and some rebel groups, 
                mistrustful of Spanish promises, retained their weapons, resulting in increased clashes.</p>
