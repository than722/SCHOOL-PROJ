    <h2>The Colonization of the Philippines</h2>
    <p class = "p1">
        The era spanning from 1565 to 1898 in Philippine history is referred to as the Spanish colonial period. 
        During this time, the Philippine Islands were governed as the Captaincy General of the Philippines within the Spanish East Indies, initially falling under the Viceroyalty of New Spain, headquartered in Mexico City. 
        However, after the Mexican Empire gained independence from Spain in 1821, the Philippines came under direct Spanish control, a period marked by governmental instability. 
        The first recorded European encounter with the Philippines occurred in 1521 during Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigation expedition, which ended tragically for him in the Battle of Mactan. 
        In 1565, Spanish conquistadors, led by Miguel López de Legazpi, embarked on the conquest of the Philippines from modern-day Mexico. Their arrival coincided with the reign of Philip II of Spain, whose name became associated with the country. 
        The Spanish colonial era came to an end with Spain's defeat by the United States in the Spanish-American War, signaling the onset of the American colonial period in Philippine history.</p1>

            <h3>The Spanish Period</h3>
            <p class = "p2">The Spanish colonial motives in the Philippines extended beyond mere commerce, initially aiming for access to the lucrative <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/spice-islands" target="_blank">Spice Islands</a>. 
                Despite losing this opportunity to the Portuguese and Dutch, the Spanish persisted in their presence in the archipelago. 
                <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinand-Magellan" target="_blank">Ferdinand Magellan</a> led the first Spanish expedition to the Philippines in 1521, 
                but subsequent attempts by King Philip II resulted in disasters until Miguel López de Legazpi established the first permanent Spanish settlement in Cebu in 1565. 
                By the late 16th century, most coastal and lowland areas were under Spanish control, with nominal conversion to Roman Catholicism.</p>

            <p class = "p2">Spanish rule initially relied on the encomienda system for taxation, but abuses led to its abandonment by the late 17th century. 
                The governor-general wielded significant power, akin to an independent monarch, dominating both political and economic spheres. 
                Manila emerged as the political, commercial, and ecclesiastical capital, facilitated by the galleon trade with Acapulco, 
                which attracted a sizable Chinese community despite periodic tensions with the Spanish.</p>

            <p class = "p2">The ecclesiastical power of the church, led by the archbishop, often rivaled that of the governor-general, 
                with religious orders amassing significant wealth through land acquisition. 
                Although the clergy aimed for full Christianization and Hispanization of the Filipino population, 
                pre-Spanish cultural practices persisted under Roman Catholic guise.</p>

            <p class = "p2">Spanish influence also impacted economic and political institutions, with attempts to consolidate populations into villages around stone churches, though traditional social structures persisted. 
               Agricultural technology evolved slowly, with shifting cultivation giving way to sedentary farming under the guidance of the friars, reinforcing class differences and empowering the pre-Spanish noble class, 
               known as the principalia, within the friar-dominated local government.</p>

    <div id="19th"></div>
    <div class="content2">
        <h4>The 19th Century</h4>
        <p class = "p3"> By the late 18th century, Europe's political and economic transformations were beginning to impact Spain and consequently the Philippines. 
            A significant catalyst for trade was the gradual dismantling of the galleon's monopoly route to Acapulco. The last galleon reached Manila in 1815, and by the mid-1830s, Manila had opened up to foreign merchants with minimal restrictions. 
            This led to increased demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp), with exports to Europe surging further following the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869.</p>

        <p class = "p3">The rise of commercial agriculture gave rise to a new social class. In addition to church-owned land and pre-Spanish nobility's rice estates, coffee, hemp, and sugar haciendas emerged, often owned by entrepreneurial Chinese-Filipino mestizos. 
            Some families that gained prominence during the 19th century continued to wield significant influence in Philippine economics and politics.</p>
        
        <p class = "p3">Public education didn't begin in the Philippines until 1863, and even then, the church dictated the curriculum. Only a small fraction of those attending school could read and write Spanish, and even fewer could speak it fluently. 
            Higher education in the colony was mainly under clerical control, but by the 1880s, many affluent individuals sent their sons to Europe for schooling. There, in a liberal environment, nationalism and reformist sentiments flourished. This environment nurtured the Propaganda Movement, which produced magazines, newspapers, poetry, and pamphlets, notably the biweekly La Solidaridad, launched in 1889. 
            José Rizal, a prominent figure in this movement, authored two influential political novels—Noli me tangere (1887; Touch Me Not) and El filibusterismo (1891; The Reign of Greed)—which stirred widespread impact in the Philippines. 
            Upon his return to the Philippines in 1892, Rizal established the Liga Filipina, advocating for modest reforms within the Spanish framework without seeking independence. 
            However, Rizal's arrest by the Spanish authorities in 1892 led to his exile and subsequent execution in 1896, which galvanized a growing commitment to independence among the less privileged class within the Philippines.</p>
        
        <p class = "p3">Shocked by Rizal's arrest, activists quickly formed the Katipunan under the leadership of Andres Bonifacio, a self-educated warehouseman. The Katipunan aimed at expelling the Spanish from the islands, preparing for armed rebellion. 
            While Filipino rebels had long existed under Spanish rule, it was the first time they were driven by nationalist aspirations and possessed the education necessary to turn their goals into reality.</p>

    <div class="content3">
        <h5>The Philippine Revolution</h5>
        <p class = "p4">In August of 1896, Spanish friars uncovered evidence of the Katipunan's plans, leading its leaders to take action earlier than planned. Revolts erupted in several provinces around Manila. Despite months of fighting, severe Spanish retaliation forced the revolutionary armies to retreat to the hills. 
            In December 1897, a truce was reached with the Spanish. Emilio Aguinaldo, a municipal mayor and rebel forces commander, received a significant sum and was permitted to go to Hong Kong with other leaders, with promises of reforms from the Spanish. However, reforms were slow, and some rebel groups, 
            mistrustful of Spanish promises, retained their weapons, resulting in increased clashes.</p>

        <p class = "p4">Meanwhile, the Spanish-American War erupted, and following the U.S. naval victory in the Battle of Manila Bay in May 1898, Aguinaldo and his followers returned to the Philippines with the assistance of Adm. George Dewey. With confidence in U.S. support, 
            Aguinaldo reorganized his forces and liberated several towns south of Manila, declaring independence on June 12. In September, a constitutional congress convened in Malolos, north of Manila, drafting a fundamental law inspired by European and Latin American models. 
            A government was established based on this constitution in January 1899, with Aguinaldo as president of the newly proclaimed "Malolos Republic."</p>

        <p class = "p4">Meanwhile, U.S. troops landed in Manila and, with Filipino assistance, forced the surrender of the Spanish commander there in August 1898. However, the Americans prevented Filipino forces from entering the city, leading to disillusionment among Filipino leaders who felt betrayed by earlier expressions of support for independence. 
            In the subsequent peace negotiations in Paris, the U.S. demanded the cession of the Philippines from Spain, which was confirmed with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898. While the treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate in February 1899, the conflict between U.S. and Filipino forces had already begun. 
            The ensuing Philippine-American War, marked by two years of counterinsurgency warfare, ended with Aguinaldo's capture in March 1901 and his call for acceptance of U.S. rule.</p>

        <p class = "p4">The Filipino revolutionary movement, driven by both national and social goals, briefly achieved independence but was thwarted by the American decision to continue administering the islands. Efforts toward fundamental social change, such as the nationalization of friar lands by the Malolos Republic, were also hindered by entrenched institutions. 
            Despite these setbacks, the proclamation of a republic in 1898 marked the Philippines as the first Asian nation to resist European colonial rule.</p>
